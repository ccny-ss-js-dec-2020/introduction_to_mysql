In MySQL Developer:
  1. Create a Database
  2. Create a Table in that Database
  3. Add 1 or more records to that Table
  4. Get the record(s) that you just added to that Table
  5. Update field(s) for the record(s) that you added to the Table
  6. Delete record(s) from the Table

Ideas for Tables:
* Table Name: animals, Columns: name, species, type, etc.
* Table Name: tvShows, Columns: name, years run, plot, etc.
* Table Name: usCities, Columns: name, population, population density, etc.
